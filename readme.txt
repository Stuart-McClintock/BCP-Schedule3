I would like to give you some information on how to use the program as well as some other information.

First of all Kush made this with me.

An admin is considered someone who is able to make scheduling changes. A user is someone who has a schedule and can get it displayed to them.

The program assumes that the first person to run it is the admin if there is not already an admin setup. In this case the admin is already setup, the username is “Admin” and the password is “123”. All exceptions are inputed by the admin.

After users create their account and input their information then they receive information about classes that they have coming up.

Thanks,
Stuart
